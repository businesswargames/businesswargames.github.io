title: Brexit Games in Hindsight 
---

Reading around the issues, [I came across a report from the Eurosceptic think tank Open Europe on a series of wargames that it organised in 2016 on Britain's relationship with Europe](http://2ihmoy1d3v7630ar9h2rsglp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/A4_Report-EU_War_Games-Digital-Ve1-FINAL.pdf)[^1]. The stakeholders were played by senior, largely centre-right, policy makers from European countries: the UK players were former Foreign Secretary Sir Malcolm Rifkind and former Chancellor of the Exchequer Lord Lamont ([an earlier, 2013 game featured a serving Leave-supporting minister, Andrea Leadsom, as the UK player](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/uk-politics-25401335/eu-referendum-playing-war-games-over-uk-future)).

I found this interesting on several levels. Most experts are agreed on the importance of after-action reviews and circulating conclusions from games (e.g. Chussil and Elgersma)[^2], and the Open Europe report gives a very clear sense of how the games were organised, the interaction between the players, and the issues that were thrown up. It is something of a rarity to see something this specific: most business wargames are confidential exercises, to the extent that many of the case studies referenced in the literature are either generic or obscure details of participants (). Public sector games are sometimes more transparent: for example, the British Army's Wargaming Guide provides a number of informative case studies. But there is nothing like this level of detail, which extends to videos of the sessions for anyone interested in reviewing them. Indeed, the conduct and conclusions of games are seldom publicised unless something has gone badly wrong ([the most prominent example being Millennium Challenge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millennium_Challenge_2002)).

The report concludes that the games "gave a pretty good approximation of how events might unfold"[^3]. With the benefit of hindsight, that understates the case. Time and again the document highlights issues that have gone on to dominate the headlines: [that immigration would be a big-ticket issue in the Brexit debate](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/immigration-worries-drove-the-brexit-vote-then-attitudes-changed/2018/11/16/c216b6a2-bcdb-11e8-8243-f3ae9c99658a_story.html?utm_term=.2dc2435507c5) but that other topics would prove more intractable; [that the EU would act collectively and resist British attempts to cherry pick](https://www.dw.com/en/germany-and-eu-tell-uk-no-brexit-cherry-picking/a-45284510); [the Canada and Norway options](https://fullfact.org/europe/brexit-trade-deals-norway-canada-options/); and the critical importance of the Irish Border, [and in recognising the potential need for special arrangements, the principle if not the specifics of the current Backstop debate](https://fullfact.org/europe/irish-backstop/).
