Welcome to Business Wargames, a website I have set up to support my interest in the use of games and simulations as a business strategy tool. 

At the moment there is relatively little content here: [the about page](/about) gives some background to the site, and [the resources page](/resources) lists books, journal articles and other resources that I have found useful in exploring the topic. However, as I develop my understanding of the subject through research and professional experience as a strategist, I intend to add new material. In the meantime, I would be very happy to hear from others interested in this subject, [either via email](mailto:contact@businesswargames.org) or [Business Wargames on Twitter](https://twitter.com/buswargames).
