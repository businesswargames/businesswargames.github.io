There is a vast literature on strategy, both in a political/military context and around the younger discipline of business strategy. However, most books focus on one area of strategy and it is a rarity to find one that addresses both: Lawrence Freedman's magisterial history is an honourable exception[^1], though written from a theoretical perspective. As a practitioner and learner attempting to synthesise military history and doctrine with business experience through this website, I was full of admiration for Stephen Bungay's [The Art of Action](https://amzn.to/2RsGpsG).   

[Bungay is a business school lecturer, former management consultant and acclaimed military historian](https://www.stephenbungay.com). His starting point is the difficulty of formulating and executing strategy in unpredictable and unstable environments, and in particular the gaps between plans and outcomes, plans and actions, and actions and outcomes. These are brought to life though a series of business vignettes and an exploration of Clausewitz's concept of friction (to provide a short and practical summary of Clausewitz's thinking is in itself no mean feat)[^2]. Bungay's proposed solution to these issues is to look for inspiration from a highly successful, innovative organisation: the Prussian army, and in particular [its pioneering Chief of Staff Helmuth von Moltke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helmuth_von_Moltke_the_Elder).

The Prussian experience is of particular interest to businesses because instead of relying on exceptional individuals in positions of authority, it concentrated on improving decision-making throughout the organisation. Moltke famously stated that "no plan of operations extends with certainty beyond the first encounter with the enemy's main strength"[^3]. In such a volatile environment, strategy should therefore be based on not attempting to plan for the unforeseeable, communicating purpose and intentions as broadly as possible, and giving junior leaders freedom of decision and action within those bounds. This approach, known to the Prussian and latterly German armies as *auftragstaktik*, remains part of modern military doctrine and is known as "mission command". In a business context, Bungay describes it as "directed opportunism". 

This model presupposes the selection and training of high-quality leaders. Bungay outlines how the transformation of the Prussian army from defeat at the hands of Napoleon to the military triumph of the Franco-Prussian War was fundamentally about people and culture, not least the move from entirely aristocratic leadership to a cohesive, professional officer corps based on promotion on merit and shared values[^4]. The instrument of this change was [the Prussian Staff College](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prussian_Staff_College). With no military background myself but having attended business school as an experienced manager, I was particularly struck by the similarities that Bungay outlines between the pedagogy and experience of the Staff College and many MBA programmes (hence the somewhat whimsical title of this review): the selection of high potential students through structured assessment; the mix of academics and experienced practitioners on the faculty; a curriculum bringing together practical and academic skills; an emphasis on debate between lecturers and students; and augmenting classroom time with exercises and Staff Rides[^5]. The MBA Staff Ride is more likely to take in Silicon Valley or an emerging economy than the Silesian marches, but the principle is the same.  
Broad interest to general managers, recommendations.
