title: Brexit Games in Hindsight 
---

Brexit has seldom been far from my thoughts this year, both as a ~~news junkie~~ informed citizen, and as a corporate executive exploring the immediate impacts and strategic implications for my employer. This week, it crossed over with my interest in business wargaming.

Reading around the issues, [I came across a report from the Eurosceptic think tank Open Europe on a series of wargames that it organised in 2016 on Britain's relationship with Europe](http://2ihmoy1d3v7630ar9h2rsglp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/A4_Report-EU_War_Games-Digital-Ve1-FINAL.pdf)[^1]. The stakeholders were played by senior, largely centre-right, policy makers from European countries: the UK players were former Foreign Secretary Sir Malcolm Rifkind and former Chancellor of the Exchequer Lord Lamont ([an earlier, 2013 game featured a serving Leave-supporting minister, Andrea Leadsom, as the UK player](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/uk-politics-25401335/eu-referendum-playing-war-games-over-uk-future)).

I found this interesting on several levels. Most experts are agreed on the importance of after-action reviews and circulating conclusions from games (e.g. Chussil, 2007 and Elgersma, 2017)[^2], and the Open Europe report gives a very clear sense of how the games were organised, the interaction between the players, and the issues that were thrown up. It is something of a rarity to see something this specific: most business wargames are confidential exercises, to the extent that many of the case studies referenced in the literature are either generic or obscure details of participants (e.g. Oriesek & Schwarz, 2008 and Herman et al., 2009)[^3]. Public sector games are sometimes more transparent: for example, the British Army's Wargaming Guide provides a number of informative case studies[^4]. But there is nothing like this level of detail, [which extends to media coverage of the sessions for anyone interested in reviewing it](https://openeurope.org.uk/intelligence/britain-and-the-eu/eu-wargame/). Indeed, the conduct and conclusions of wargames are seldom publicised unless something has gone wrong to a newsworthy extent ([the most prominent example being Millennium Challenge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millennium_Challenge_2002)).

The report concludes that the wargames "gave a pretty good approximation of how events might unfold"[^5]. With the benefit of hindsight, that understates the case. Time and again the document highlights issues that have gone on to dominate the headlines: [that immigration would be a big-ticket issue in the Brexit debate](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/immigration-worries-drove-the-brexit-vote-then-attitudes-changed/2018/11/16/c216b6a2-bcdb-11e8-8243-f3ae9c99658a_story.html?utm_term=.2dc2435507c5) but that other topics would prove more intractable; [that the EU would act collectively and resist British attempts to cherry pick](https://www.dw.com/en/germany-and-eu-tell-uk-no-brexit-cherry-picking/a-45284510); [the Canada and Norway options](https://fullfact.org/europe/brexit-trade-deals-norway-canada-options/); and the critical importance of the Irish Border, [and in recognising the potential need for special arrangements, the principle if not the specifics of the current Backstop debate](https://fullfact.org/europe/irish-backstop/).

All of this makes a compelling case for the validity of wargaming as a tool for exploring future strategies. But with the benefit of hindsight, it also presents a challenge. Open Europe conclude that "the UKâ€™s preferred post-Brexit deal with the EU is not a given and requires the approval of others. Therefore, it is clear that the UK needs to have a plan A, but also a B and C"[^6]. Scarcely two weeks from the March 29th deadline, this reads like advice that should have been heeded. I also wonder if the variable of friction in the UK political process was sufficiently considered: for example, how would the conclusions have changed if, instead of an individual UK player, the game had represented opposition parties, business and public opinion. In a context where a participant in this series of wargames said last week that she was ["beginning to wonder what game the European Union was playing"](https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-eu-leadsom/what-brexit-game-is-eu-playing-british-parliament-leader-leadsom-asks-idUSKBN1QQ085), it does seem that if the games were successful at predicting the issues, they were less so at building mutual understanding and influencing the outcome of negotiations.
