My interest in using games and simulations as a tool for testing strategy dates started at business school, and developed as I applied the theory learned there to strategy and corporate development in a multinational business. I set this website up in February 2019 as a place to document and share my research and experience. Over time I hope that it will become a useful resource to other researchers and practitioners.
